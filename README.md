# tkey-sign

`tkey-sign` creates and verifies cryptographic signatures of files.
The signature is created by the [signer device
app](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-device-signer) running on the
[Tillitis](https://tillitis.se/) TKey. The signer is automatically
loaded into the TKey by `tkey-sign` when signing or extracting the
public key. The measured private key never leaves the TKey.

See [Release notes](RELEASE.md).

## Usage

Get a public key, possibly modifying the key pair by using a User
Supplied Secret, and storing the public key in file `-p pubkey`.

```
tkey-sign -G/--getkey [-d/--port device] [-s/--speed speed]
[--uss] [--uss-file secret-file] -p/--public pubkey
```

Sign a file, specified with `-m message`, possibly modifying the
measured key pair by using a User Supplied Secret, and storing the
signature in `-x sigfile` or, by default, in `message.sig`. You need
to supply the public key file as well which `tkey-sign` will
automatically verify that it's the expected public key.

```
tkey-sign -S/--sign [-d/--port device] [-s speed] -m message
[--uss] [--uss-file secret-file] -p/--public pubkey [-x sig-file]
```

Verify a signature of file `-m message` with public key in `-p pubkey`.
Signature is by default in `message.sig` but can be specified
with `-x sigfile`. Doesn't need a connected TKey.

```
tkey-sign -V/--verify -m message -p/--public pubkey [-x sigfile]
```

Alternatively you can use OpenBSD's *signify(1)* to verify the
signature but you need to compute the SHA-512 of the file first and
feed that to the verification. We provide a handy script that does
this:

```
signify-verify message pubkey
```

Exit code is 0 on success and non-zero on failure.

See the manual page for details.

## Examples

All examples either load the device app automatically or works with an
already loaded device app.

Store the public key in a file.
```
$ tkey-sign -G -p key.pub
```

Sign a file using the signer's basic secret or the identity of an
already loaded signer while also checking that you have the right
public key in a file:

```
$ tkey-sign -S -m message.txt -p key.pub
```

Verify a signature over a message file with the signature in the
default "message.txt.sig" file:

```
$ tkey-sign -V -p key.pub -m message.txt
```

or

```
$ signify-verify message.txt key.pub
Signature Verified
$
```

## Build & install

The easiest way is to:

```
$ go install github.com/tillitis/tkey-sign-cli/cmd/tkey-sign@latest
```

After this the `tkey-sign` command should be available in your
`$GOBIN` directory.

Note that this doesn't set the version and other stuff you get if you
use `make`.

### Building

If you have Go and make installed, a simple:

```
$ make
```

or, for a Windows executable,

```
$ make tkey-sign.exe
```

should build `tkey-sign`. A pre-compiled signer device app binary is
included in the repo and will be automatically embedded.

Cross compiling the usual Go way with `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment
variables works for most targets but currently doesn't work for
`GOOS=darwin` since the `go.bug.st/serial` package relies on macOS
shared libraries for port enumeration.

### Building with tkey-builder

If you want to use the tkey-builder image and you have `make` you can
run:

```
$ podman pull ghcr.io/tillitis/tkey-builder:4
$ make podman
```

or run tkey-builder directly with Podman:

```
$ podman run --rm --mount type=bind,source=$(CURDIR),target=/src -w /src -it ghcr.io/tillitis/tkey-builder:4 make -j
```

Note that building with Podman by default creates a Linux binary. Set
`GOOS` and `GOARCH` with `-e` in the call to `podman run` to desired
target. Again, this won't work with a macOS target.

### Installing on Linux

You can install `tkey-sign` and reload the Linux udev rules to get
access to the TKey with:

```
$ sudo make install
$ sudo make reload-rules
```

### Reproducible builds

You should be able to build a binary that is a exact copy of our
release binaries if you use the same Go compiler, at least for the
statically linked Linux and Windows binaries.

Please see [the official
releases](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-sign-cli/releases) for
digests and details about the build environment.

### Building with another signer

For convenience, and to be able to support `go install` the signer
device app binary is included in `cmd/tkey-sign`.

If you want to replace the signer used you have to:

1. Compile your own signer and place it in `cmd/tkey-sign`.
2. Change the path to the embedded signer in `cmd/tkey-sign/main.go`.
   Look for `go:embed...`.
3. Change the `appName` directly under the `go:embed` to whatever your
   signer is called, so the agent reports this correctly with
   `--version`.
4. Compute a new SHA-512 hash digest for your binary, typically by
   something like `sha512sum cmd/tkey-sign/signer.bin-v0.0.7` and put
   the resulting output in the file `signer.bin.sha512` at the top
   level.
5. `make` in the top level.

## Building the signer

1. See [the Devoloper Handbook](https://dev.tillitis.se/) for setup of
   development tools. We recommend you use tkey-builder.
2. See the instructions in the [tkey-device-signer
   repo](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-device-signer).
3. Copy its `signer/app.bin` to
   `cmd/tkey-sign/signer.bin-${signer_version}` and run `make`.

To help prevent unpleasant surprises we keep a digest of the signer in
`cmd/tkey-ssh-agent/signer.bin.sha512`. The compilation will fail if
this is not the expected binary. If you really intended to build with
another signer, see [Building with another
signer](#building-with-another-signer) above.
