# tkey-sign

`tkey-sign` is a utility that can do and verify an Ed25519
cryptographic signature over a digest of a file using the
[Tillitis](https://tillitis.se/) TKey. It uses the [signer device
app](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-device-signer) for the actual
signatures.

It can also verify a signature by passing files with the message,
signature, and the public key as arguments.

See [Release notes](RELEASE.md).

## Usage

```
$ tkey-sign <command> [flags...] FILE...
```

Commands are:
```
  sign        Create a signature
  verify      Verify a signature
```

Usage for the sign-command are:
```
$ tkey-sign sign [flags...] FILE
```
with options:

```
  -p, --show-pubkey     Don't sign anything, only output the public key.
      --port PATH       Set serial port device PATH. If this is not passed,
                        auto-detection will be attempted.
      --speed BPS       Set serial port speed in BPS (bits per second). (default
                        62500)
      --uss             Enable typing of a phrase to be hashed as the User
                        Supplied Secret. The USS is loaded onto the TKey along
                        with the app itself. A different USS results in
                        different public/private keys, meaning a different identity.
      --uss-file FILE   Read FILE and hash its contents as the USS. Use '-'
                        (dash) to read from stdin. The full contents are hashed
                        unmodified (e.g. newlines are not stripped).
      --verbose         Enable verbose output.
  -h, --help            Output this help.
```

Usage for the verify-command are:
```
$ tkey-sign verify FILE SIG-FILE PUBKEY-FILE
```

## Building

You have two options, either our OCI image
`ghcr.io/tillitis/tkey-builder` for use with a rootless podman setup,
or native tools.

With podman you should be able to use:

```
$ ./build-podman.sh
```

which requires at least `git` and `make` besides podman. See below for
setting things up.

With native tools you should be able to use our build script:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

Both of these also clones and builds the [TKey device
libraries](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-libs) and the [signer
device app](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-device-signer) first.

If you want to do it manually please inspect the build script, but
basically you clone the `tkey-libs` and `tkey-device-signer` repos,
build the signer, copy it to `signer.bin` here and then `make`.

You can install `tkey-sign` and reload the udev rules to get access to
the TKey with:

```
$ sudo make install
$ sudo make reload-rules
```

### Installing Podman

On Ubuntu 22.10, running

```
apt install podman rootlesskit slirp4netns
```

should be enough to get you a working Podman setup.
