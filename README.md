# tkey-sign

`tkey-sign` is a command to do a cryptographic signature (ed25519)
over a file using the [Tillitis](https://tillitis.se/) TKey. It uses
the [signer device
app](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-device-signer) for the actual
signatures.

It is currently just a test tool and can take at most 4 kiB large
files.

See [Release notes](docs/release_notes.md).

### Usage

You need the tkey-runapp from [the apps
repo](https://github.com/tillitis/tillitis-key1-apps) the and the
[`signer`](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-device-signer). Build them
first.

Then:

```
$ tkey-runapp [flags...] [path-to-signer-app]
$ tkey-sign [flags...] [FILE]

```

Options are:

```
  -p, --show-pubkey   Don't sign anything, only output the public key.
      --port PATH     Set serial port device PATH. If this is not passed,
                      auto-detection will be attempted.
      --speed BPS     Set serial port speed in BPS (bits per second). (default 62500)
      --verbose       Enable verbose output.
      --help          Output this help.
```

## Building

You have two options, either our OCI image
`ghcr.io/tillitis/tkey-builder` for use with a rootless podman setup,
or native tools.

### Building with Podman

We provide an OCI image with all tools you can use to build the
tkey-libs and the apps. If you have `make` and Podman installed you
can us it like this in the `tkey-libs` directory and then this
directory:

```
make podman
```

and everything should be built. This assumes a working rootless
Podman. On Ubuntu 22.10, running
```
apt install podman rootlesskit slirp4netns
```

should be enough to get you a working Podman setup.

### Building with host tools

You need `golang` and `make`.

```
$ make
```
